# GameSaves

In this project I will try to search for a gavesave of a prefered game and upload it to git.
Then it can be a cross computer\platform gamesave which can be played from any device ones the script is running.

this will help me and other people who play a game from multiple devices to continue the game everywhere they go.
the version conrol of github will provide the timestamp and any aditional iformation about the gamesave,
once you fucked up in your game, you know where to go back to.
